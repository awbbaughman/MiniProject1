Mini Project 1
This project displays a knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript throughout, but especially on the "Riddles" page. There are areas where I know I can improve (like more specific button functionality on the "Riddles" page, or creating a dynamic list of items on the "Lore" page). However, I think this project provides a great starting point for further embellishments and additions.

Please refer to my comments for insight into my design challenges.
